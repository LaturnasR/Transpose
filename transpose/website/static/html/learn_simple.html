        <p class="info">First, we look for words indicating an unknown quantity. The word 'number' does not indicate any value unlike
          the word 'twelve'. Hence, we assign it a variable 'x'.
          Doing so will change our phrase to: <mark class="d-inline-block">Twice the sum of x and twelve.</mark> Notice that the word 'a' was
          also replaced along with the word 'number'
          as it does not have any significant meaning.</p>
        <p class="info"><small>Note: A variable is used to represent an unknown quantity and can be represented as any of the
            lower-case letters in the alphabet.</small></p>

        <h2>2. Identify</h2>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <p class="info">Next, we have to identify the keywords in our phrase. In our case, we have two operator keywords namely:
          'Twice' and 'the sum of' (highlighted in green). Each
          operator keywords have their own operands (highlighted in blue).
        </p><br><br>
        <p class="info">
        The operator keyword 'twice' has 'the sum of x and twelve' as its operand:
      </p>
        <p class="lead">
          <span class="bg-success bg-opacity-25">Twice</span> <span class="bg-primary bg-opacity-25">the sum of x and
            12</span><br><br>
        </p>
        <p class="info">
        Since 'the sum of x and 12' is another operation, it has its own operator and operands as well: <br>
      </p>
        <p class="lead">
          <span class="bg-success bg-opacity-25">The sum of</span> <span class="bg-primary bg-opacity-25">x</span> and
          <span class="bg-primary bg-opacity-25">12</span>

        <p class="info">
          Now it is time to apply the meaning of our identified operator keywords. First is the word 'twice', which is a
          mathematical multiplicative operation that means to repeat the value by two times.
          However, this operator's operand 'the sum of x and 12' is yet to be solved, meaning, the other operator will
          be performed first.
          'The sum of' keyword simply means that its operands are to be added together. Gathering our analyzations, we
          can imply that the idea of the phrase is:
          add x and twelve together, then double their result.

        <p class="info">Lastly, we just have to convert the idea into mathematical symbols.</p>
        <p class="lead d-inline-block"><mark>add x and twelve &#8594 `x + 12`</mark></p><br>
        <mark class="lead d-inline-block">double the result &#8594 `2 * (x + 12)`</mark>

        <p class="info">The pair of parentheses () is used to group an operation to indicate that it is to be performed first.
          If a grouped operation has another grouped operation inside, for example: `2 + (4 / ((2 + 2)))`, then the
          innermost operation `(2 + 2)` will be performed first.</p>
        <p class="info"><small>Note: The dot operator (<b>⋅</b>) which is another symbol for multiplication besides (×), was used to
            avoid confusion with the variable `x`. </small></p>
