        <p class="info">First, we look for words indicating an unknown quantity. We have 'x', which was already assigned a variable,
          and 'a number' which is yet to be assigned. Since 'x' was already used to represent an unknown quantity, we
          should use another letter to assign 'a number'. Usually, we just use the next letter 'y', this will make our
          phrase to be: <mark><span class="d-inline-block">difference of x and five times y.</mark></span></p>

        <p class="info">Next, we have to identify the keywords in our phrase. In our case, we have two operator keywords namely: 'the
          difference of' and 'times' (highlighted in green). Each
          operator keywords have their own operands (highlighted in blue).
          <br>
          Since this phrase is ambiguous, it could have more than one possible answers depending on how it is
          interpreted.

            The keyword 'times' has 'the difference of x and 5' and 'y' as its operands:

            Since 'the difference of x and 5' is another operation, it has its own operator and operands as well:<br>

            Let's start with the keyword 'times', as it has the complete phrase with its operands. Times simply means to
            multiply, which means that we will multiply the first operand 'the difference of x and 5' by the second operand 'y'.
            Since 'the difference of x and 5' is another operation within an operation, it is to be performed first. The
            keyword 'the difference of' means that the first operand 'x' will be subtracted by the second operand '5'
