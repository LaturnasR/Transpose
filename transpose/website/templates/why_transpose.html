		<br>
		<p align="justify" class="etc_info">&emsp;&emsp;According to Programme for International Student Assessment or PISA's statistics in 2018, the mean score of 15 year-old Filipinos' 
		performance in secondary level mathematics is 353, that is 136 points lower than the average of 489 points among 77 countries participating in PISA, 
		making the Philippines ranked 75th or the 3rd lowest performing country. According to the studies, one of the students' hindrance in learning 
		mathematics is comprehending word problems. Students are having difficulties formulating these problems to turn into math expressions for easier 
		solving.</p>
		<br>
		<p align="justify" class="etc_info">&emsp;&emsp;Based on DepEdâ€™s K-12 Basic Education Curriculum, the translation of English phrases to mathematical phrases and vice versa are mostly 
		encountered by Grade 7 students. Although online tools that solve math problems exist, they are either not broad enough to perceive problems 
		involving multiple operators or complex enough to perceive simple structured phrases that are commonly used in grade 7 curriculum. This where 
		Transpose comes in, a supplemental tool that caters to the phrases encountered in Grade 7 that would aid the students translate them sensibly.</p>
